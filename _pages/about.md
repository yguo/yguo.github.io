## Desperado
--

Desperado, why don't you come to your senses

You've been out ridin' fences

For so long now

Oh, you're a hard one

I know that you've got your reasons

These things that are pleasin' you

can hurt you somehow

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy

She'll beat you if she's able

You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet

Now it seems to me, some fine things

have been laid upon your table

But you only want the ones

that you can't get

Desperado

Oh, you ain't getting no younger

Your pain and your hunger

They're driving you home

And freedom, oh, freedom

Well that's just some people talking

Your prisoner is walking through this world all alone

Don't your feet get cold in the winter time?

The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine

It's hard to tell the night time from the day

And you're losing all your highs and lows

Ain't it funny how the feeling goes

Away...

Desperado

Why don't you come to your senses?

Come down from your fences, open the gate

It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you

You better let somebody love you

(let somebody love you)

You better let somebody love you

Before it's too..oooo.. late
